# Local AI

This project is about running AI models locally on your own machine without depending on cloud services.  
The goal is to give developers and learners a way to experiment with language models, test performance, and build small applications while keeping everything private and offline.

---

## Why I Built This
I wanted to explore how large language models can be used without sending data to external servers.  
It’s useful for:
- Privacy‑focused projects
- Offline experimentation
- Learning how AI inference works under the hood
- Benchmarking performance on local hardware

---

## Features
- Load and run AI models locally (no cloud dependency).
- Simple interface to interact with the model.
- Support for text generation and basic Q&A.
- Configurable model size and parameters.
- Easy to extend for custom applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (main language)
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow** (model backend)
- **Transformers library** (Hugging Face)
- Optional: **Streamlit/Flask** for UI
